         <p style="line-height: 2; font-size:18px; color:var(--black); padding:1rem 0;  text-align: justify;">My name is Trina Morados, but please - call me TC. Iâ€™m a self-taught, calligrapher and engraver known around the internet as @inksandcoffee, typically recognized for my modern design work, ultra-detailed journal spreads, and addiction with coffee. <br><br> All of those efforts are really the icing on the cake of my career as an artist, which frequently still feels like a pleasant dream. I'm so delighted to welcome you to my tiny corner of the internet, whether you want to collaborate on a creative project or need a creative bestie.
         <br><br>The essence and driving force behind what I do has evolved into my capacity to enrich others' experiences. I realized I wanted to share this kind of pleasure with as many people as I could after seeing the smiles on people's faces when they saw the artwork I do. Everyone should be delighted and feel that glint of excitement.<br><br></p>
